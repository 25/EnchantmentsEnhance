## Introduction
This is a personal project made to enhance playability of a server.

## Feature
- [x] Enhancing
- Enhancing is the act of increasing the stats of your items. Understanding how enhancing works is probably the most important part of the plugin.
- [x] Failstack
- Failstacks is used to signify the number of failed attempts a player has made at enhancing. Failstacks increase the chance of a successful enhancement attempt. This chance increase depends on the gear type and the enhancement level it already has.
