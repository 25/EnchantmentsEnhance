## Introduction
This is a personal project made to enhance playability of a server.

## Feature
- [x] Enhancing
- Enhancing is the act of increasing the stats of your items. Understanding how enhancing works is probably the most important part of the plugin.
- First of all, the enhancement levels after +15 are called PRI (+16), DUO (+17), TRI (+18), TET +(19) and PEN (+20). To enhance armor and weapons above +15 you need to start using concentrated black stones instead of regular ones.
- [x] Failstack
- Failstacks is used to signify the number of failed attempts a player has made at enhancing. Failstacks increase the chance of a successful enhancement attempt. This chance increase depends on the gear type and the enhancement level it already has.
- [x] Downgrade
- When you try to enhance a weapon or armor to TRI or higher and fail, the enhancement level of your item drops by one level. So on a failed attempt DUO -> PRI, TRI -> DUO and TET -> TRI. You can use an item called Cron stones to protect from this.
- [x] Lore
- Choose between two modes:
Tradeable: keep-item-on-death, personal trading is allowed.
Untradeable: keep-item-on-death, cannot be stored, cannot be dropped.
- [x] Localization
- Supported language: cn, en.
- [x] Customized Item Name
- You could change the names of the items upon successfully enhance or downgraded an item.
- [x] GUI
- [x] Force Enhancement
- Force guarantees a successful enhancement.
- [x] Advice of Valks
- A special item that can give you failstacks depending on the level of the advice. 
- [x] Blacksmith’s Secret Book
- Allows you to store failstacks by creating Advice of Valks. 
- [x] Lifeskilling
- Mining ores gets you Concentrated Magical Black Stone (Weapon).
- Chopping trees gets you Concentrated Magical Black Stone (Armor).
- Fishing gets you Black Stone (Weapon) and Black Stone (Armor).
- Killing mobs gets you Black Stone (Weapon) and Black Stone (Armor).
